# PMM Dump Documentation
    
The `pmm_dump` client utility performs a logical backup of the performance metrics, collected by the PMM Server and imports them into a different PMM Server instance.

PMM Dump allows you to share monitoring data, collected by your PMM server, with Percona Support team securely.

    Starting with PMM 2.41, the standalone client utility has been seamlessly integrated into PMM and is easily accessible from the main menu at > Help > PMM Dump. 
    We strongly advise transitioning to this built-in version unless you need to use an older PMM version.
